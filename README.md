# Facial Recognition System using OpenCV and Flask

This project is a facial recognition web application built using OpenCV and Flask. It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and integrates a trained recognition model with a custom frontend interface. The application captures live webcam input to identify and authenticate users.

## Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascade classifier  
- Facial recognition using OpenCV's LBPH recognizer  
- Flask-based backend serving a web application  
- Real-time webcam capture and recognition  
- Add new users dynamically to the face dataset  
- Integrated frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
